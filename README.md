## To do

### Lineage QC

- check SNPs for each lineage, are there some sequences that have missing sites at what otherwise be defining SNPs
- are there any obvious sequences that look like they belong in different lineages
- check ambiguity content
- check monophyly within a tree (figtree2, usher and nextclade), or within updown-topranking gofasta
- check decision tree for each lineage, see if any conflicting decisions or any that dont seem to fit
- get 95% consensus of a lineage, check if outliers and remove

### Lineage discovery

- diversity scanning
- polecat -> fast spreading, locations
- geographic clustering
- How to flag new lineages?
